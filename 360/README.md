# 360° Video and Audio Capture for VR Applications


## Introduction: The Great Skrillex Train Dome
![Skrillex on a Train with Dome](images/skrillex.jpg "Skrillex on a Train")

working notes:
*in the past I have done a plethora of research into immersive environment capture, augmentation, and presentation
projection onto dome shaped surfaces, 360° video applications, scene creation in Unity3D
new and inventive ways to capture an aesthetic that has yet to be seen or used in immersive applications.
imo technical limitations create new opportunities for inventiveness and provide an atmosphere where a new aesthetic can be created; 
some of this is inspiration, thought starters, technical resources, 
but mainly this is a living document that can be referred to in order to immerse oneself immersive experience creation. Its a document to explore what is emerging, and what is about to be possible. *

#### What Does Any of This Have to do with Virtual Reality?!
It is my observation that this first wave of VR using mobile devices, and this new surge of interest and investment in VR products has its on primarily two things: gaming and immersive documentaries.
yet original and unique art, aesthetics and storytelling are waiting in the wings, ready to be compellingly used within VR. 'Cinematics' in the medium will come about with a new breed of creators who will start defining the cinematic language, concepts, and approaches that will take this emerging format to the next level, eventually allowing it to stand on its own as an entirely new and 'proper' art form.

It is my firm belief that the most compelling approaches to immersive storytelling within the VR medium will be include such concepts as non-linearty, contrasted and varied temporality, visual juxtaposition, mixed media (3D Video with CGI), 3D soundscapes, and new digital aesthtics. Through the inclusion of opposites, the pairing and mixing of mediums, and a fervent experiemental spirit, VR will become 'its own thing' and those at the forefront of the medium will have an opportunity to create an entirely new art form.

The ideas, approaches, concepts, and inspirations found in this document are meant to provide an entry point and a topical resource that will help define how VR becomes as original a storytelling medium as cinema and 'cinematic' television.

Overall, this document is dedicated to capturing panoramas, spherical video, and how to do all this on a budget, or with a creative approach that produces a creative aesthetic. All of this has a clear path to being integrated into experience for YouTube 360 Video, Google Cardboard, Occulus Rift, etc. Through this document you can find everything you need to create worlds that can be inhabited and interacted with via the various VR mediums available today.

## Paul Bourke
Paul Bourke is the man. He is an Australian professor who has been working for the last few decades on everything related to immersive media via his original work and research into such things as dome projection, 3D geometry and materials, the math related to projection mapping, how to capture panoramas, how to project panaorama into physical environments, and so so so so much more. He is actively working, speaking at conferences, and as far as I know, is still the number 1 goto resource for projection mapping and immersive environment creation; the math, the code, the concepts, the tools, he has done all of it!

His main focus for a time was related to [large and full scale dome projection installations](http://paulbourke.net/dome/faq.html), but in the process his work has also become highly applicable to the creation of 3D and 360° environments in VR.

Paul Bourke's work and concpets will be referenced and linked to throughout this document, and while many of his works are older, the concepts and appraoches and math, are still sound and very much applicable to capturing, creating, and producing immersive experiences.

## Fisheye Lenses
![180 Degrees](images/fish1.jpg)

When creating content for a full-size dome projection, a 180° fisheye lens was used to capture high resolution video to be projected into the dome, providing users a view that engaged their peripheral vision, virtually stepping into the image. The 180° content was also used in a custom iOS app that allowed the user to pan around the 180° view. 

This was nearly 5 years ago, and VR was still only a dream, but a dream on the horizon. Using 2-3 180° degree camera rigs or, creative stiching of video and imagery captured from a single DSLR with a fisheye lens, this method could be used to capture and/or create compelling high resolution 360° visualscapes for VR and 360 video applications.

Kevin Burg and Jamie Beck are a photographers that have been traveling the world for very large clients, taking some amazing photographs, and bringing them to life utilizing subtle movements with the stillness of the photograph. Almost unnoticable at times, the movement provides an interesting juxtaposition against the static image the movements exists within.

Pamela Reed and Matthew Rader, known as [REED+RADER](http://reedandrader.com/) are a couple of friends of mine that are, in my my opinion, pushing the boundaries of the moving image in a bright and unique way, unlike anything I have ever seen. Through integration of unique hair and makeup, set designs, multi-angle still phototography, video, 3D game engines, and more, these two very interesting people have swiftly become a highly sought after production team for large fashion and entertainment clients. For example, you may have seen their [recent promos for the MTV Music Awards featuring Miley Cyrus](http://reedandrader.com/mtvvmas.html#content) ( and her cat ):
