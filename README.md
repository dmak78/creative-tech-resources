# 360째 Video and Audio Capture for VR Applications


## Introduction: The Great Skrillex Train Dome
![Skrillex on a Train with Dome](images/skrillex.jpg "Skrillex on a Train")

in the past I have done a plethora of research into immersive environment capture, augmentation, and presentation
projection onto dome shaped surfaces, 360째 video applications, scene creation in Unity3D
new and inventive ways to capture an aesthetic that has yet to be seen or used in immersive applications.
imo technical limitations create new opportunities for inventiveness and provide an atmosphere where a new aesthetic can be created; 
some of this is inspiration, thought starters, technical resources, 
but mainly this is a living document that can be referred to in order to immerse oneself immersive experience creation. Its a document to explore what is emerging, and what is about to be possible.

## Paul Bourke
Paul Bourke is the man. He is an Australian professor who has been working for the last few decades on everything related to immersive media via his original work and research into such things as dome projection, 3D geometry and materials, the math related to projection mapping, how to capture panoramas, how to project panaorama into physical environments, and so so so so much more. He is actively working, speaking at conferences, and as far as I know, is still the number 1 goto resource for projection mapping and immersive environment creation; the math, the code, the concepts, the tools, he has done all of it!

His main focus for a time was related to [large and full scale dome projection installations](http://paulbourke.net/dome/faq.html), but in the process his work has also become highly applicable to the creation of 3D and 360째 environments in VR.

Paul Bourke's work and concpets will be referenced and linked to throughout this document, and while many of his works are older, the concepts and appraoches and math, are still sound and very much applicable to capturing, creating, and producing immersive experiences.

## Cinemagraphs and GIF Art

### Cinemagraphs
Somewhere between the still image and movie exists the *cinemagraph*.

> A cinemagraph is a living moment in an otherwise still photograph.

Kevin Burg and Jamie Beck are a photographers that have been traveling the world for very large clients, taking some amazing photographs, and bringing them to life utilizing subtle movements with the stillness of the photograph. Almost unnoticable at times, the movement provides an interesting juxtaposition against the static image the movements exists within.

Pamela Reed and Matthew Rader, known as [REED+RADER](http://reedandrader.com/) are a couple of friends of mine that are, in my my opinion, pushing the boundaries of the moving image in a bright and unique way, unlike anything I have ever seen. Through integration of unique hair and makeup, set designs, multi-angle still phototography, video, 3D game engines, and more, these two very interesting people have swiftly become a highly sought after production team for large fashion and entertainment clients. For example, you may have seen their [recent promos for the MTV Music Awards featuring Miley Cyrus](http://reedandrader.com/mtvvmas.html#content) ( and her cat ):
