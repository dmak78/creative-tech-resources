## Introduction and Philosophy

in the past I have done a plethora of research into immersive environment capture, augmentation, and presentation
projection onto dome shaped surfaces, 360° video applications, scene creation in Unity3D
new and inventive ways to capture an aesthetic that has yet to be seen or used in immersive applications.
imo technical limitations create new opportunities for inventiveness and provide an atmosphere where a new aesthetic can be created;

## Cinemagraphs and GIF Art

### Cinemagraphs
Somewhere between the still image and movie exists the *cinemagraph*.

> A cinemagraph is a living moment in an otherwise still photograph.
